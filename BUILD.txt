How to build the project:
    Software:
        Visual Studio 2022 with "C++ CMake tools for Windows" installed
            - if this is not installed, the project will not build.
            - it can be found in the Visual Studio 2022 installer then modifying 
                Visual Studio 2022 and clicking the "Optional" dropdown arrow. There
                the "C++ CMake tools for Windows" should be checked and installed.
    
    How to build the project:
        - extract files from "ECE3504_CompArc_Pr01-main.zip"
        - open Visual Studio 2022(VS) in the folder.
        - VS will automatically build a folder called "out" and will identify that this step has been completed.
        - now, from the "Startup Item" dropdown, select "mips_disassembler.exe"
        - then in the toolbar find "Build" and select "Build All"
            - a status in the Output should show "Build All succeeded."
        - to run the executable, a file is required. Provided in "TestCases" are several test files and their corresponding solutions.
            - once a file is selected, copy it's filepath
            - in the powershell command window, enter 
                
                .\out\build\x64-Debug\mips_disassembler.exe
            
              followed by the filepath in quotations.
            - an example powershell line looks like this:

                .\out\build\x64-Debug\mips_disassembler.exe ".\TestCases\test_case3.obj"

            - the line should run and print out, 
                
                "successfully created '*.asm'"
            
            - the file can be found in the filepath where the *.obj is found.
